Beginning with the Brookings Insitute dataset, a random sample of positions from industries that are transitioning into automated processes were taken. As shown, the majority of the positions did not require a four year degree to successfully do the job. For this, the two variables that I will focus on are Automation Potential (the probability of an industry receiving any kind of automation) and Typical Education Required

One thing to note is that all but one industry listed had an average salary of less than $100,000 which could be a factor in automation being more prevalent in this specific set of positions
