# Unemployment-and-Automation-Project

This project aimed to find a correlation between unemployment rates and automation in select industries in the United States during the last ten years. By doing so, I would illustrate whether or not the increased use of automated processes in manufacturing would significantly hurt the job market. My hypothesis was that there was a direct correlation between the two (i.e. an increase in automation would lead to a increase in unemployment). As firms have begun to switch to machines to replace human capital, the input costs for producing the same goods will decrease while the aggregate supply of it will increase since it is considered a form of production efficiency. Using historical trend analysis, I sought to discover a strong correlation between the two variables in hopes of getting a better idea on how to assess automation in the long run of the economy.

Beginning with the Brookings Insitute dataset, a random sample of positions from industries that are transitioning into automated processes were taken. As shown, the majority of the positions did not require a four year degree to successfully do the job. For this, the two variables that I will focus on are Automation Potential (the probability of an industry receiving any kind of automation) and Typical Education Required

One thing to note is that all but one industry listed had an average salary of less than $100,000 which could be a factor in automation being more prevalent in this specific set of positions. Additionally, the "U.S. Totals" shown at the bottom of the graph are averages for all industries including in the national GDP; not just for the positions selected. When observing the statistical aspect of this dataset in particular, one inference that stood out to me was the mean automation percentage. The reason for is because of how close it is to crossing over into the majority threshold. In other words, the probabilty of an industry having a form of autonomous process in their production is almost a toss-up. Although the percentage may get higher as time goes on, the general unemployment rate in the United States will illustrate the overall trajectory of the relationship between autonomous processes and unemployment rates.

Moving over to the dataset provided by the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics, it shows the total unemployment rate in the United States from the last twenty years. While it does originally split the data based on the civilian's race, we are just trying to focus on the collective data as it is more indictive of the general population.

The gray areas shown on the chart are the time periods in which the United States was experiencing an economic recession which explains the sudden rise in unemployment rates. However, the unemployment spike between October 2018 and October 2020 is due to the coronavirus pandemic.
