# Unemployment-and-Automation-Project

This project aimed to find a correlation between unemployment rates and automation in select industries in the United States during the last ten years. By doing so, I would illustrate whether or not the increased use of automated processes in manufacturing would significantly hurt the job market. My hypothesis was that there was a direct correlation between the two (i.e. an increase in automation would lead to a increase in unemployment). As firms have begun to switch to machines to replace human capital, the input costs for producing the same goods will decrease while the aggregate supply of it will increase since it is considered a form of production efficiency. Using historical trend analysis, I sought to discover a strong correlation between the two variables in hopes of getting a better idea on how to assess automation in the long run of the economy.

Beginning with the Brookings Insitute dataset, a random sample of positions from industries that are transitioning into automated processes were taken. As shown, the majority of the positions did not require a four year degree to successfully do the job. For this, the two variables that I will focus on are Automation Potential (the probability of an industry receiving any kind of automation) and Typical Education Required

One thing to note is that all but one industry listed had an average salary of less than $100,000 which could be a factor in automation being more prevalent in this specific set of positions. Additionally, the "U.S. Totals" shown at the bottom of the graph are averages for all industries including in the national GDP; not just for the positions selected.

Moving over to the dataset provided by the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics, it shows
